## What is this?

This is a **massively vibe-coded monster Frankenstein** based on [phuc-nt/mcp-atlassian-server](https://github.com/phuc-nt/mcp-atlassian-server).

It works. _Mostly_. Sometimes. Usually when you need it to. Probably.

Features were added, bugs were fixed (and introduced), code was refactored, un-refactored, then refactored differently. The logger exploded, got duct-taped, then optimized. Resources became tools. Tools became the primary interface. The primary interface is now questioning its life choices. Everything is fine. 🔥

**Tools available:** 32 (we counted, twice, got different answers both times)

**Lines of code that make sense:** Some

**Tests written:** You're looking at it

**Production ready:** Define "production"

**Probability this README is accurate:** Non-zero

## Setup for Cursor

Slap this bad boy into your Cursor MCP config (`~/.cursor/mcp.json` or via Settings → MCP):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "atlassian": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": ["/path/to/your/mcp-atlassian-server/dist/index.js"],
      "env": {
        "ATLASSIAN_SITE_NAME": "yourdomain.atlassian.net",
        "ATLASSIAN_USER_EMAIL": "email@company.com",
        "ATLASSIAN_API_TOKEN": "APITOKEN",
        "LOG_LEVEL": "warn"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

**Note:** Cursor shows all MCP logs with an `[error]` prefix in the output panel. This is just Cursor's UI - it doesn't mean something is broken! The `[MCP]` prefix helps identify our server's logs. If you find the logs too chatty, set `LOG_LEVEL` to `warn` or `error` to reduce noise.

### Getting Your Atlassian API Token

1. Go to https://id.atlassian.com/manage-profile/security/api-tokens
2. Click "Create API token"
3. Give it a name (like "MCP Server")
4. Copy the token and paste it into your config

## Building

```bash
npm install
npm run build
```

Then reload Cursor's MCP servers (or just restart Cursor because why not).

## What Can It Do?

- **Confluence:** Read/write pages, list spaces, manage comments (it's like a CMS but enterprise™)
- **Jira:** Read/write issues, manage sprints, create filters, update dashboards (project management goes brrr)
- **Everything else:** Probably? We added a lot of tools and lost track

## Documentation

- **[Quick Reference](./docs/quick-reference.md)** - All 32 tools with examples
- **[Architecture Guide](./docs/architecture.md)** - How the code actually works
- **[API Reference](./docs/api-reference.md)** - Complete tools & resources list
- **[Old README](./README_OLD.md)** - Original proper documentation

## Credits

- Original amazing work by [phuc-nt](https://github.com/phuc-nt/mcp-atlassian-server)
- Vibe-coded modifications by an anonymous developer with heavy Cursor assistance
- Pain: Harold (hiding it like a champ)
- Coffee consumed: Yes
